# BLAST-analysis-using-Python
Automated high throughput BLAST analysis using Python
# Author and Developer
The proposed project is Initiated and Organized(Original Idea) by Sanjay S. I was the developer (Coding) of the project.

# The Descreption
The Project's primary purpose is to find only the top 3 blast results from the NCBI portal entering every DNA/RNA sequence manually. 

# The Process of the project
The INPUT 'input1.fasta' ( ATGC queries must be placed in a file with this file name and extension, each query must have one Line space (Must use one Enter in betweeen each Sequence, it is also important to hit enter after the last ATGC query in the file.))

The PROGRAM using BioPython, the program will find the blast results. The program uses a filter which looks for Top 3 values E value more than 200 

The OUTPUT after executing the project output.txt is automatically generated and if a file already exists program will use the same.
